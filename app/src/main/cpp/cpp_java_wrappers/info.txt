This directory should contain wrappers between C++ and Java implementations

- Basically only World class should be wrapped to Java class using swig

  * World implements basic methods which are used to transfer info between
  C++ physics implementations and object as well as logic implemented with Java

- Other classes in this directory shouldn't be wrapped to Java: they should remain
  C++ and World internal classes
